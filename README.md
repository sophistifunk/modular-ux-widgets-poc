# Modular UX Widgets Proof of Concept (WIP)

This repository contains the proof-of-concept code for building and embedding Modular UX Widgets: Compound React components that are more task-specific and self-contained than the simpler, building-block kind of components found in a common UI Component library package (such as Button, Table, DropDown, etc).

Example use cases:

 * Pipeline run graph
 * Pipeline creation wizard
 * Pipeline activity table 

## Building the PoC

### Requirements

 * Reasonably modern node.js
 * Global install of gulp-cli

### Step 1 - Framework

````
cd framework
npm i
npm run dist
cd ..
````

### Step 2 - Example Widget

````
cd example-widget
npm i
npm run dist
cd ..
````

### Step 3 - Example Extension
````
cd example-widget-plugin
npm i
npm run dist
cd ..
````

### Step 4 - Example Host App
````
cd example-host
npm i
npm start
````
